purple tunnel
macular degeneration
social isolation 
and excellent salary

and back problems if that sounds good to

you might I recommend a career in

programming but how does one actually

learn to code as a complete beginner

well the answer is actually very simple

you need to spend countless hours

staring at the blue light of a computer

screen hitting the keys until something

cool comes out the other side learning

to code was by far the best investment I

ever made in my career and it cost

approximately zero dollars thanks to all

the free stuff on the internet luckily

you don't need to be very smart but you

do need to work hard and put in the

hours required to learn the actual skill

but hours doing what exactly where do I

even start sadly there is no guaranteed

step-by-step program every true coder

will need to go on their own Quest and

slay their own dragons in this video



many many moons ago i wanted to learn to code but didn't know how to start , so like everyone ,i opened up youtube and looked up programming tutorials watched them thinking i would become a programming genius overnight , but no that actually did not happen , turns out i failed miserably and left programming for 3 months thinking not to touch it again.

while later my dad needed a website
so i figured i was at least smart enough
to learn html and somehow a few months
later i figured out how to ship my first
website the important thing to recognize 
when learning to code is that
[[lesson 1]]
