this is probably the first thing you have learnt in python,  

how to use functions like print()
when to use ""
the = assignment operator 
indentation:
	matters 
all of this is the bulk what we see in python 

and i want you to think of this as the alphabets of python 
sort of structure and rules of what gives python its *programming* "language" title 

just like our communications languages have certain rules to piece together words for us humans to understand it , the developers of python programming language who are much more smarter that you or myself have designed their own syntax in a way , that , ones how have learnt it , can communicate seamlessly, just like how both of us can communicate in telugu, it forms a common language for which is understandable by you , me and not just any human but your computer too.

Now you don't need to worry about trying to rote learn the syntax, as surly there will come a day where you will be not only be able to read python just like how you read English but also understand it and be able to predict what a block of code is doing. 

and as you will see in your future classes you will see how other languages will have their own syntax , and advantages and disadvantages over python , but ultimately it comes down to using the correct programming language to the job. 

now i don't wanna stall this part all most of you already know this part. 

## fun fact actually: you can type in 
``` python
import this 
```
and you will see the design principles of the python programming language, from back when it was first being created , its a really poetic piece of text which you should check out when you are free. 

Moving on to more advanced topics and what you have learnt until now.
