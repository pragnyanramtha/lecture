This is probably the first thing you have learned in Python:

How to use functions like `print()`.
When to use `""`.
The `=` assignment operator.
Indentation: matters.
All of this is the bulk of what we see in Python.

And I want you to think of this as the alphabet of Python, the sort of structure and rules of what gives Python its "programming language" title.

Just like our communication languages have certain rules to piece together words for us humans to understand, the developers of the Python programming language, who are much smarter than you or myself, have designed their own syntax in a way that those who have learned it can communicate seamlessly. Just like how both of us can communicate in Telugu, it forms a common language which is understandable by you, me, and not just any human, but your computer too.

Now, you don't need to worry about trying to rote learn the syntax, as surely there will come a day where you will not only be able to read Python just like how you read English but also understand it and be able to predict what a block of code is doing.

And as you will see in your future classes, you will see how other languages will have their own syntax and advantages and disadvantages over Python. But ultimately, it comes down to using the correct programming language for the job.

Now, I don't want to stall this part, as most of you already know this part.

## Fun fact, actually: you can type in
```python
import this
```
and you will see the design principles of the Python programming language from back when it was first being created. It's a really poetic piece of text which you should check out when you are free.

Moving on to more advanced topics and what you have learned until now.
