[[cpu and memory]]


I believe and hope all of you know how to use and assign variables.

But what most of you don't know is how these are actually stored and used inside a computer.

Inside our computers, there are these chips known as RAM modules, which store and run the code on demand.

If we zoom into one of these chips, here is something we would probably see.

Everything in Python is stored in these cells known as bytes.

And these bytes are made up of 8 bits. To represent something, we just turn on or turn off a bunch of these bits. And there is a table known as an ASCII table which understands these 1s and 0s and converts them into sensible characters that are understandable by us humans.
