[[cpu and memory]]


I believe and hope all of you know how to use and assign variables.

but what most of you dont know is how these are actually stored and used inside a computer

inside our computers there are these chips known as Ram modules which store and the code and run it on demand.

if we zoom into one of these chips , here is something what we would probably see

everything in python is a stored in these cells known as bytes , 

and these bytes are made up of 8 bits, to represent something we just turn on or turn of a bunch of these bits , and there is a table known as a ascii table which converts understands these 1s and 0s and converts them into sensible characters that are understandable by us humans
