as i said if you have a goal, you should only think about that destination. 

what did i mean by that ?

if your goal is to build a website, what are you waiting for ?

why are you still practicing how to center a div or layout structure is ?

is your goal really to build a website or learn html or css?

because you can never truly learn html and css , css itself contains over a 100s of millions property value pairs.

it will never be enough, you just need to start 

sure your first website won't look good, it will be clunky , ugly

no matter how much you keep learning , it will never be enough.
