[[Functions]]

Another way to introduce functions to someone who has a decent math background is to build upon their existing mathematical paradigms. This is often called functional programming or a functional paradigm.

So, the way that mathematics teaches us about functions is a little bit different than what programming teaches us about functions. And what I really mean is the difference in terminologies and the difference in best practices or naming conventions.

So what is an example of a function in mathematics? Broadly speaking, it is something that will take an input, and it'll munch on that input, it'll look at that input, and it will do something to that input. And based on what that input is, it will produce a given output.

What is an example of a function?

I could have something like f(x), and x tends to be the variable most used for an input into the function. And the name of a function, f, tends to be the most-used variable. But we'll see that you can use others—is equal to 2x + 3.

What would happen if we input 2 into this function?

The way that we would denote inputting 2 is that we would want to evaluate f(2).

This is saying, let's input 2 into our function f.

And everywhere we see this x here, this variable, you can kind of use it as a placeholder to see what variables we have to replace in the input.

Replace it with our input.

So let's see.

2 * x would become 2 * 2, which is 4. And in this case, 4 + 3, which is 7, would be our final output.

Now, what would f(3) be?

Well, once again, everywhere we see this variable, we'll replace it with our input.

So f(3), 2 into 3 is 6, 6 plus 3 is 9.

And hence, it is going to be equal to 9.

And so on. Basically, x can be whatever we want, and whereas in this case, 2x + 3 is what we get when we evaluate the function f(x).

And what this f(x) notation is conveying is that x is the input of this function and f(x) is what it will return, assuming x and f(x) can be whatever we want.

Here, x can be whatever we wish that we want, whereas the 2x + 3 is what we get.

Here, x is the input, and f(x) is the output.
