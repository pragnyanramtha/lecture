[[Functions]]

Another way to introduce functions to someone who has decent math background is to build upon their existing mathematical paradigms, and this is often called as functional programming or a functional paradigm.

So , the way that mathematics teaches us about functions is a little bit different than what programming teaches us about functions. and what i really mean is the difference in terminology's and the difference in best practices or naming conventions.

so what is an example of a function in mathematics , broadly speaking , is something that, will take an input, and it'll munch on that input, it'll look at that input, it will do something to that input. And based on what that input is, it will produce a given output.

What is an example of a function?

I could have something like f(x) and x tends to be the variable most used for an input into the function. And the name of a function, f tends to be the most-used variable. But we'll see that you can use others-- is equal to, 2x +3

What would happen if we input 2 into this function?

The way that we would denote inputting 2

is that we would want to evaluate f of 2.

This is saying, let's input 2 into our function f.

And everywhere we see this x here,

this variable you can kind of use as a placeholder to see what variables we have to replace in the input.


replace it with our input.

So let's see.

2 * x is would become 2 * 2 and which is 4 
and in this case, 4 + 3 which is 7 would be our final output 

Now what would f of 3 be?

Well, once again, everywhere we see this variable,

we'll replace it with our input.

So f of 3, 2 into 3 is 6 , 6 plus 3 is 9.

and hence It is going to be equal to 9.

and so on , basically x can be whatever want and where as in this case 2x + 3 is what we get when we evaluate the function f(x) 

and what this f(x) notation is conveying is that x is the input of this functions and f(x) is what it will return, assuming x and f(x)  can be what ever we want.  

here x can be whatever we wish that we want , where as the 2x + 3 is what we get 

here x is the input , and f(x) is the output
