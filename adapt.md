If i may , let me share a thought of mine 

All of you know about equality right ?

many people fight for it, some don't care 

but here is the question ?

do you think all humans are truly equal ? 

sure everyone are born equal , but that fact changes pretty soon 

academic effort is what sets some people apart 

in whatever way we observe this , humans change based on their actions 

speaking honestly , at the end of the day , equality is just a myth.

and most of us , live our lives deny the fact we live in a meritocracy.

SO then what sets us apart ? 

what measures our worth ?

here is what i think...

imagine you die tomorrow ?

would you be happy with what you have achieved ?

would you be proud of what you have done ?

have you experienced everything in life ?

Don't get me wrong and definitely don't misunderstand me 

i am not saying that you should give up on everything and work yourself to death , sure enjoy all you want , but there are sacrifices you need to make to achieve your goals , set deadlines , take a risk, set your goals. i assure you will experience more happiness when you have indeed achieved your goals.
