There is a really nice quote in Japanese:

剣を持つ者が皆戦士ではない。だが、真の戦士が剣を持てば、誰にも止められない。

(Ken o motsu mono ga mina senshi dewa nai. Daga, shin no senshi ga ken o moteba, dare ni mo tomerarenai.)

Now, none of you here have probably understood a word of that, but it basically means that:

"Not everyone with a sword is a warrior, but a true warrior with a sword is unstoppable."
