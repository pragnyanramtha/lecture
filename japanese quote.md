there is really nice quote in Japanese,  

剣を持つ者が皆戦士ではない。だが、真の戦士が剣を持てば、誰にも止められない。

Ken o motsu mono ga mina senshi dewa nai. Daga, shin no senshi ga ken o moteba, dare ni mo tomerarenai

now none of you hear have probably understood a word of that but it basically means that    

not everyone with a sword is a warrior, but a true warrior with a sword is unstoppable.
