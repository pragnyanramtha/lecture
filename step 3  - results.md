 Step three, the final step. You need a constant source of feedback to improve your fight. every week probably on a Sunday evening just sit down and think about what have you done during the previous week. What are the things that you did and what can you do better that's it? It's a simple framework TSF. Every day at a specific time sit down to fight the battle with the world and every week give yourself some feedback. But then this leads to a different problem which is people put in the efforts and then they think putting the efforts is the only thing that they have to do. See never confuse movement with progress. You might be sitting and working every day. You might be sitting and studying every day, but if you don't see the results, you're definitely doing something wrong. And I hate people who say hard work doesn't mean success because it does. Hard work will lead to success, but the amount of success will depend upon the direction.

It's just like physics. You apply force and the block will move. Now, the force required might be higher based upon the mass of the block and the friction. But if you apply enough force, the block will move unless and until you're pressing it against the surface. So, success depends both on the amount of hard work and the direction. Spacey physics. Got it. Now finally the moment has come. l'd like to tell you a story.
