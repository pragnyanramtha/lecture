 Step three, the final step. You need a constant source of feedback to improve your fight. 
 you need that dopamine hit.
 
Every day at a specific time you sit down to fight the battle with the world and 
every week i want you to give yourself some feedback.

understand what you have done, seek out what you have achieved. 

But then this leads to a different problem which is people put in the efforts and then
they think putting the efforts is the only thing that they have to do.

See never confuse movement with progress.
You might be sitting and working every day.
You might be sitting and studying every day,
but if you don't see the results, you're definitely doing something wrong.
And I hate people who say hard work doesn't mean success because it does. 
Hard work will lead to success, but the amount of success will depend upon the direction.

only do what you need to, focus on what's important not what's required.

Now finally the moment has come. l'd like to tell you a story.
