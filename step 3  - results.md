Now suppose you do lock in everyday for 2 hours and sit down ? what do you learn ?
what are you supposed in that two hours ?

you see people put in the efforts and then
they think putting the efforts is the only thing that they have to do.

never confuse movement with progress.
You might be sitting and working every day.
You might be sitting and studying every day,
but if you don't see the results, you're definitely doing something wrong.
And I hate people who say hard work doesn't mean success because it does. 
Hard work will lead to success, but the amount of success will depend upon the direction.

only do what you need to, focus on what's important not what's required.

understand what you have done, seek out what you have achieved. 

and then you will truly understand how you have grown.
everytime you face a problem you are stuggling againist , you dont need to start from the bottem, use what you have learnt in your life , and solve the problems 

get absorbed in the problem,
know your abilities precisely,
control your abilities to their at most potential,
then challenge yourself to the toughest and hardest thing you can do.
in that movement you will pull out an exceptional performance.
which will push you to the next level.

to the outsiders , it will look like a miracle, but there is a formula to it. 

you see there is a time in your life when you know a skill , a concept and there is a time in your life where you don't that.

and there is no clear path between these two states of being , all it takes is a leap of faith.
