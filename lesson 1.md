hard work is more valuable than talent 

talent is great if you have it and 
there are 10x developers out there where things just click on a much higher level 

but programming is a skill very similar to playing a musical instrument or juggling

for most people you totally suck at first then you feel like a genius when

you code your first program then you realize you totally suck again and this pattern goes on and on forever in an infinite loop 

learning is supposed to be painful in fact
i believe that you need pain to grow
when learning a guitar you need to put your fingertips through a
lot of pain before you build calluses 

in programming you'll have to bang your head against the keyboard a bunch of times until you figure out how to make these error messages go away 

so if you don't have talent 

be prepared to embrace the hard work now 

since we have recently completed your mid exams , i appreciate the hard work all of you have put in, though i also think that this might be a good time to take a step back and realize where we are right now. and see what we have learnt as a whole

with this we will be moving on to our first topic in this lecture 


SO what i wanna do right now , is sort of summarize and build a map of everything you have been learning for the past month, so that this will enable you to take a step back and realize what you have been thinking
