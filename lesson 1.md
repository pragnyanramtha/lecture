Hard work is more valuable than talent.

Talent is great if you have it, and there are 10x developers out there for whom things just click on a much higher level.

But programming is a skill very similar to playing a musical instrument or juggling.

For most people, you totally suck at first. Then you feel like a genius when you code your first program. Then you realize you totally suck again, and this pattern goes on and on forever in an infinite loop.

Learning is supposed to be painful. In fact, I believe that you need pain to grow. When learning a guitar, you need to put your fingertips through a lot of pain before you build calluses.

In programming, you'll have to bang your head against the keyboard a bunch of times until you figure out how to make these error messages go away.

So if you don't have talent, be prepared to embrace the hard work.

Now, since we have recently completed your mid-exams, I appreciate the hard work all of you have put in, though I also think that this might be a good time to take a step back and realize where we are right now and see what we have learned as a whole.
