In programming, there's so much to learn that you are never going to retain everything.

I used to be a really good web developer, but at this point, I've forgotten almost everything about it.

And that's no big deal because memorizing syntax doesn't really matter. The thing you really want to learn and retain are programming patterns. Essentially, everything you do in programming is problem-solving. The idea is to create a repertoire of tools in your brain that you can then use to solve virtually any problem in any language.

For example, if you need to loop over something but you've never used JavaScript before, you still understand the trade-offs between a `for` loop and a `while` loop.

This is the exact reason that if you go to a technical interview, they usually don't care which language you use. They just want to see that you know how to solve problems. And in some cases, they may only have you write pseudocode on a whiteboard to analyze your problem-solving skills.

So, in learning, I would recommend trying out a few different languages and learning the one that feels most natural to you. For most people, I think Python is ideal because it has a minimal syntax, is extremely popular, and is also just a very useful language to know in general. But other languages like Java, C, JavaScript, and C++ are also good languages to start with. But again, it's about becoming a problem solver, not about memorizing syntax.

But before we learn how to become good problem solvers, we must see how things work under the hood. [[keywords]]
