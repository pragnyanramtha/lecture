In programming there's so much to learn you are never going to retain everything 

i used to be a really good web developer but at this point i've forgotten almost everything about it 

and that's no big deal because memorizing syntax doesn't really matter the thing you really want to learn and retain are programming patterns essentially everything you do in programming is problem solving the idea is to create a repertoire of tools in your brain that you can then use to solve virtually any problem in any language 

for example if you need to loop over something but you've never used JavaScript before you still understand the trade-offs between a for
loop and a while loop 

this is the exact reason that if you go to a technical interview they usually don't care which language you use 
they just want to see that you know how to solve problems 
and in some cases they may only have you write pseudocode on a whiteboard to analyze your problem-solving skills so in learning 

i would recommend trying out a few different languages and learn the one that feels most natural to you for most people i think python is ideal because it has a minimal syntax is extremely popular and is also just a very useful language to know in general but other languages like java , C,  JavaScript ,C++ are also good languages to start with but again

it's about becoming a problem solver not about memorizing syntax.

but before we learn how to become good problem solvers we must see how things work under the hood. [[keywords]]
