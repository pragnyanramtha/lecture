Firstly,

if you are still think that watching lectures and working all day will make you better.

**if you still think** that discipline is all it takes to become the best .

And 

if you force yourself to work or solve problems.

you can never beat the person who just wants too.

YOU cannot beat this guy who is just obsessed to work.

then how do you become better than him ?

you see 

you don't need to be the smartest person in the room 

but you need the most obsessed one  

and that is the key to your growth 

Now, then how do you become **obsessed ?**
