Firstly,

if you are still think that watching lectures and grinding python problems will make you better.

**if you still think** that discipline is all it takes to become the best .
And 

if you force yourself to work or solve problems.

you can never beat the person who just wants too.

YOU cannot beat this guy who is just obsessed to work.

then how do you become better than him ?

you see 

you don't need to be the smartest person in the room 

but you need the most obsessed one  

and that is the key to success  

Now, then how do you become **obsessed ?**

now at this point if you still listening and don't agree with me, i don't want you to misunderstand me, sure you can get a decent job and get a decent salary, but if you agree .

i want you to try and understand what i am conveying .
