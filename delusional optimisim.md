if you are still think that watching lectures and grinding python problems
will make you better.

**if you still think** that discipline is all it takes to become the best .

if you force yourself to work or solve problems.
you can never beat the person who just wants too.

YOU cannot beat this guy who is just obsessed to work.

Now, then how do you become **obsessed ?**

now at this point if you still listening and don't agree with me, i don't want you to misunderstand me, sure you can get a decent job and get a decent salary, but if you agree  

i want you to try and understand what i am conveying .

okay, imagine this 

if you have a goal right now, i want you to only think about that goal, that end result , don't focus on the road you have to walk , focus on the destination you have to reach. 

don't think about how frustrating building a website is , think about the revenue you will be making form it.

don't think about how hard the coding problems are , think about you solving them in a technical interview at google.

once you do this enough , you start to love the process , you don't need motivation , you don't feel like giving up, you actually want it.  

But obviously , this mindset won't work unless you have a goal.

so let me ask you ? what is your goal , what do you want ? what do you want to achieve. 

If you don't have a goal? i would recommend you find one , doesn't matter if your goal is to be the best, impress your crush , get a job or simply to earn money.  

all you need is to find that goal and be heads down chasing it.

[[choose you goal]]
