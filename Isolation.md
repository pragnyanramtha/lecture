Let's start with the first one. And think this is one of the most powerful lessons from this list. 

Real growth happens in isolation.

When look back into my life, when first went to inter college,
I was dumb af, had zero confidence. 
And failed in the first weekly exams.

But cut to 2025, just 2 years later,
I've improved in every single thing possible.
I went from who needed to explanations to someone who explained stuff.
From zero confidence to speaking in front of all of you,
All this growth happened only because i pulled back from my social circle 
when i went into complete ghost mode. 
 
Sometimes you have to disconnect with others just so that you can reconnect with yourself. 

Now you don't need to stop talking to all of your friends for months and months but at least give yourself 2 hours every day to learn new stuff to reflect on your journey and to think about what matters to you and what doesn't.

The days you don't spend time with yourself are the days that you drift.
If you're always surrounded by noise, you'll never hear your own mind.
