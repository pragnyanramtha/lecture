$you see, Real growth happens when you lock in.

When i look back into my life, when first went to inter college,
I was dumb af, had zero confidence. 
And failed in the first weekly exams.

But cut to 2025, just 2 years later,
I've improved in every single thing possible.
I went from someone who needed to explanations to someone who explained stuff.
From zero confidence to speaking in front of all of you,
All this growth happened only because i isolated myself form everyone locked in.
 
Sometimes you have to disconnect with others just so that you can reconnect with yourself. 

Now you don't need to stop attending the college and lock yourself in your room stop talking to all of your friends for months and months but at least give yourself 2 hours every day to learn new stuff to reflect on your journey and to think about what matters to you and what doesn't.

The days you don't spend time with yourself are the days that you drift.
If you're always surrounded by noise, you'll never hear your own mind.

But Ramtha ? how do you LOCK IN ?
I have never done it before ?
NO, YOU have done it, indeed you do it everyday.
When you play your favorite game , you lock in.
when you watch reels you lock in.
and when you have a goal you need to achieve you lock in.
