Okay, imagine this:

If you have a goal right now, I want you to only think about that goal, that end result. Don't focus on the road you have to walk; focus on the destination you have to reach.

Don't think about how frustrating building a website is; think about the revenue you will be making from it.

Don't think about how hard the coding problems are; think about you solving them in a technical interview at Google.

Once you do this enough, you start to love the process. You don't need motivation, you don't feel like giving up, you actually want it.
This goal will make you obsessed.

But obviously, this mindset won't work unless you have a goal.

So let me ask you: what is your goal? What do you want? What do you want to achieve?

Now, it doesn't matter if your goal is related to computer science or something else entirely.

And if you don't have a goal at all? Well, I would recommend you find one. It doesn't matter if your goal is in computer science or entrepreneurship or literally to earn a lot of money.

All you need to do is lock in and be heads down chasing that goal.
