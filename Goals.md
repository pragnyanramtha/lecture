okay, imagine this 

if you have a goal right now, i want you to only think about that goal, that end result , don't focus on the road you have to walk , focus on the destination you have to reach. 

don't think about how frustrating building a website is , think about the revenue you will be making from it.

don't think about how hard the coding problems are , think about you solving them in a technical interview at google.

once you do this enough , you start to love the process , you don't need motivation , you don't feel like giving up, you actually want it.  

But obviously , this mindset won't work unless you have a goal.

so let me ask you ? what is your goal , what do you want ? what do you want to achieve. 

If you don't have a goal? i would recommend you find one , doesn't matter if your goal is to be the best, impress your crush , get a job or simply to earn money.  

all you need is to find that goal and be heads down chasing it.
