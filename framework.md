But again, coming back to how you learn faster, we have three steps in this.

at the end of the day , everything in the world boils down to 2 things and if you learn these 2 , well , you can pretty much learn anything.

speaking about the two things , they are 

Pattern finding and problem solving.

all subjects are derivatives of one of these 2 fields or both of them.

English is all about finding patterns in sentences to express them in a meaningful way.

mathematics is all about solving new problems using existing theorems which are indeed a standardized list of patterns in rigorous forms.

programming is all about making software which solves an existing problem, which are usually done by finding patterns within code.
