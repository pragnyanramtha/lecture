Now, this gets us to point, which is to stop living like a bird in someone's cage.

if you actually follow your goals , there will be people who judge you every step in the way.

For a very long time in my life, 
I used to worry about what other people thought of me very seriously. 
Every single time I wanted to try new stuff, I used to think about what my relatives would think of me, what my friends would think, and what my parents would think of me. 
And I think that some people still do this, though subconsciously.

You see, in life, you can only ever live as yourself. You obviously can't switch bodies with anyone, so the least you can do is be who you truly want to be.

You don't need to be the guy who they think you are.

You can change your character based on the goals you have.
You don't need to give a shit about what others will think of you. 

So sometimes, feel free to break the image that people have about you just because you can. 

If you can't be happy with yourself, you can never be happy with anyone else.
