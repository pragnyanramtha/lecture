Now, this gets us to another point, which is to stop living like a bird in a someone's cage.

For a very long time in my life, 
I used worry about what other people think of me very seriously. 
Every single time i wanted to try new stuff, I used to think about what will my relatives think of me, what will my friends, what will my parents think of me ? 
and i think that some people still do this though subconsciously.

you see in life you can only ever live as yourself you obviously cant switch bodies with anyone, so  the least you can do is be who you truly want to be.

You don't need to be the guy who they think you are .

You can change your character based on the goals you have.
you don't need to give a shit about what others will think of you. 

So sometimes feel free to break the image that people have about you just because you can. 

if you can't be happy with yourself, you can never be happy with anyone else. 

Now the next one is the secret to reach your goals faster and it is the exact path i use to achieve goals faster in my life. 

See, as a disclaimer, i  don't consider myself to be successful yet because I'm fighting my own battles every day. I'm just like you, maybe a few steps ahead, but still have a lot to do in my own life.
