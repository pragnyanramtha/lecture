But Ramtha, how do I actually grow? It's simple.

Most things in life can be categorized into 5 things, skills and abilities, we call them. 

To get to know about this, you need to ask yourself, who are you exactly? I mean sure you give people your name, but what defines you exactly?

Well, the Indian education system thinks it's 2 things:

1. Your pattern recognition ability: things like how well are you able to remember the things that you have already learnt, how well are you able to recognize problems you have already done.
2. And the second thing is your problem-solving ability: how well are you able to derive solutions given non-trivial information.

But people are not just defined based on that; there are many other things too.

but for now i will regarding your problem solving ability as programming and your pattern recognition ability as mathematics, interchangeably.  

Some skills are not taught in schools, and one of them is the abilty to learn.

many people don't realize that learning in and of itself is a skill.

And learning that skill will definitely boost the time taken to learn other things by a lot, and once you realize this, you will observe that you start learning other things way faster than normal.

Yes, surely there are some things that you cannot learn, but there are also things that you will realize, and your views will change.

And sometimes you feel like you have reached the limit, but turns out there are other things you have to learn before going all in on something.

And when you learn, you can indeed use these concepts to grow in other fields too.

And when you do, your view upon the world will change; you start finding new things much more important than previous ones.

And when you actually love what you are doing, you will become the top 1% in that skill. 

sure you will have a different, skill set based on who you are , but the process you learn is still the same.

For this to be possible, you need to evolve.

but how do you actually learn , well here is a 5 step method with a example that works well for me.

first you learn something , doesn't matter where , could be class , a yt video, a course etc., but at least you should be able to absorb what someone wanted to actually convey.

second you practice, use what you have to learnt to practice new things , this will teach you how to apply anything you have learnt.

and the third is , experiment, in this part you can have some fun , try out the thing not as intended , test out its limits , boundaries, just so you know how it works under the hood.

next you build something with, it doesn't have to be the perfect greatest application ever made, the least should be able to do is take in some input , and somehow utilize the concept you have learnt along the way.

and the final thing you do once the application is running is refine , check where it could be better or faster. and once you have done the refining part you will most probably realize a way for your program to be better , so now you have another concept to learn.  

a bit hard to understand , well here is an example i use build 100s of applications.

lets say i want to understand about the concept for loops in python, 

lets start with the first thing which is to learn, you absorb as much as you can from any source you can find, well for me rn , all i have is a answer from mrv Q/A booklet.

so i will try my best to absorb the most from this part right here.

with just that one bit of knowledge here i come to a practice , so here is something i do somethings like repeated printing , to really understand the why we are using this loops in programming.

going to the next part we experiment , you see i have been wondering about this part in my program , the range part , so mysterious, i mean lemme have a closer look at it. , hmm , wait is this a function just like all the other functions ? huh , then what is it doing here, 

wait lemme see what it is actually returning , so  lets just give it an arbitrary value and check for what it gives out , i know that all functions sorta take in a input and give out some output , so lets , see , huh , it just prints its self , maybe something is going on inside the program , let me print it as a list.

boom , look at that, so range indeed was just a list , it was a function which took it a integer as input and gave a listlike object as its output .

basically , range is a function which takes in a value as input , and return a list as the output.

interesting, so by experimenting with this i have learnt something which i would probably never have normally known.

now that's out of the way , lets build a flames game,
idk if you have ever played it, but i have, so basically we take in the name of 2 people, remove the common letters, then iterate across both the names using flames, and we check where it lands on.

so how do we implement this in python ?

we first take in 2 inputs , obvi, then maybe its better if we deal with them in lists , instead of actual strings.

now , we here we can use a for loop to remove common letters between , the first and second name.

once we do this , we will have to 2 lists without any common letter now at this point we can just count up the letter in both of them and eliminate options in FLAMES.

and badda boom , there you go , we have our answer.

if you didn't understand that, its alright, no one understands anything by listening, you can only learn something by experiencing, experimenting, building it yourself, not the other way around.

well that's that for how you learn, but there are 2 more things i would like to share with you.
