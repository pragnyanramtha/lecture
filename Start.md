There are people way dumber than you 
 
And I learned something.

Something clicked inside of me.

Because from that day, I have been learning things faster than ever.

After that day, I didn't need anyone to teach me; I was capable of adapting.

By the way, if you are wondering who this , well, it's about time you know.
