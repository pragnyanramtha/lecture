In January of 2023, i enrolled into one of hardest introduction to computer science courses available at Harvard known as Cs50, Now 6.5 million people started that course along with me, but less than 1% completed it and that year I got a chance to speak with one of the best professors in computer science.  
 
And I learned something.

Something clicked inside of me.

Because from that day, I have been learning things faster than ever.

After that day, I didn't need anyone to teach me; I was capable of adapting.

By the way, if you are wondering who is this , well it's about time you know.
