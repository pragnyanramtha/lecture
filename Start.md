In January of 2023, i enrolled into the hardest computer science course of Harvard known as  Cs50, and that year 6.5 million people started that course along with me, but only less than 1% completed it, that year I spoke with one of the world experts in computer science

and he said something to me,

he said something to me that changed how I was learning until that point.

he said something to me that had me thinking ever since,

before that , if you were living under a rock, and somehow were not bothered by my presence, let me introduce myself again.
