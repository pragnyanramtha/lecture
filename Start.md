Hello, World !

I am Pragnyan Ramtha, 17 y/o, and I'm currently doing an internship at reputation dao company, a us funded ai research and web3 company.

That's the part some of you know.

But let me tell you something: I can confidently say that I am way lazier than you, but I am certain that I can achieve things in my life that you can never expect.

Now, if you simply don't care about getting better or if you are a 10/10 on life right now , you can go ahead and relax.

But if you do wanna be in the top 1%, listen very closely, because this mindset will change the way you think and learn forever.
