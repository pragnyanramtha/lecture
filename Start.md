In January of 2023, i enrolled into the hardest computer science course of Harvard known as  Cs50, and that year 6.5 million people started that course along with me, but only less than 1% completed it, that year I spoke with one of the world experts in computer science

and he said something to me,

he said something to me that changed how I was learning until that point.

he said something to me that had me thinking ever since,

Now i won't tell you what he told me exactly, but , I'll share something similar.

Btw, if you are wondering who is this guy talking shit on the stage is, well it's about time you know.
