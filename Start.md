In January of 2023, i enrolled into the hardest computer science course of Harvard known as  Cs50, and that year 6.5 million people started that course along with me, but only less than 1% completed it, that year I spoke with one of the world experts in computer science.

and i learnt something,

something clicked inside of me, 

because from that day i have been learning things faster than ever.

after that day, i didn't need anyone to teach me, i was capable of adapting.

also for purposes, you will later learn there be a tune playing in the background , so i hope you don't mind.

Btw, if you are wondering who is this guy talking shit on the stage is, well it's about time you know.
