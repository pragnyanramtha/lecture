The story of two of my friends Ramu and Somu see before a couple of years both of them wanted to learn programming.

So they started watching videos about it.
They started making road map about it.

But after a month Ramu felt that he has learned enough.

So he directly started to go to hackathons and applying for internships. 

His intention was not to make a lot of money or actually win the hackathons but to join these hackathons and internships and connect with people who are experienced in programming. So he went to a lot of hackathons and applied 30 to 40 internships and he finally got an offer.

But meanwhile, Somu felt that he should actually learn more.

So he started watching more videos. He started reading a couple of books. He even started doing a couple of courses.

He just felt that he wasn't ready to do internships. Now 3 months passed by, Ramu just finished his internships and Somu was still learning more about programming. 

6 months passed by, Ramu did one more internship. But Somu understood that there's Al in marketing now and he also needs to learn about it first. He just felt that he should not rush because he wasn't ready yet.

Now two years passed by. Ramos's manager in the previous internships loved his work and offered him a full-time job. Somu was still learning more about AI and machine learning.

5 years passed by and guess what? 

Somu is still watching videos and learning more about Quantum computing. And Ramu just finished 3 years at his job and finally got promoted as a Senior engineer at a company.

While Ramu felt that he has achieved something in his life, Somu felt like a loser. 

Ramu's parents are proud of him. Somu's parents are worried about him. But what went wrong? Both are equally smart. Both went to the same college. Both are equally hardworking as well, right? So what actually went wrong?

i think you got the answer. You see, in life, you'l never be ready for most of the things. So stop waiting for the right time to come because maybe when you feel it's the right time, it might already be too late. Got it? So yeah, that is it. These are a couple of things that I wanted to share with you today.
