[[Functions]]

so what i want you guys to do right now , is rewire your brain form connections between these two concepts.

the functions in python are not a remote concept , instead they are just a robust, powerful and much more flexible option than what pure mathematics has to offer us.

and with this, unlike in math, we can not only manipulate numbers but also, strings,  lists, dictionaries and many more data structures
