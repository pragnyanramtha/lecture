[[Functions]]

So, what I want you guys to do right now is rewire your brain and form connections between these two concepts.

The functions in Python are not a remote concept. Instead, they are just a robust, powerful, and much more flexible option than what pure mathematics has to offer us.

And with this, unlike in math, we can not only manipulate numbers but also strings, lists, dictionaries, and many more data structures.
