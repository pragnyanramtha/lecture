to start doing anything in life, you need to have resolve and if your goal is not strong enough to fuel your resolve. you can put it a few conditions to renforce your resolve.
   
For example, when first started learning this programming, I had to make sure that I do it well and don't give up in between. So, i set at a specific time on phone during which a specific tune would play,

this sound , when i would hear it , I used to stop doing everything else and used to come back to my room to start learning these things.

So, So this sound this was my trigger, when this sound played is when I would stop doing everything else. I would lock in and disconnect from the world.

and the actual beauty of this is, you can design your own trigger, 
your trigger can be a specific time, an alarm , a timer , a specific period in college, or after your everyday chores. 

the timing isn't the issue, it's you ability to lock in.
