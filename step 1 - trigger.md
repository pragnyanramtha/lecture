 to start doing anything in life, you need a trigger. You need like a specific time to start doing that thing. For example, when first started learning this programming, machine learning and all this artificial intelligence thing, I had to make sure that I do it well and don't give up in between. So, every day after dinner at around 10 p.m., I used to stop doing everything else and used to come back to my room to start learning these things. So, 10 p.m. here is my trigger. 10 p.m. is when I would stop doing everything else.
