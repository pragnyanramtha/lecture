to start doing anything in life, you need a trigger. You need like a specific time to start doing that thing. For example, when first started learning this programming, machine learning and all this artificial intelligence thing, I had to make sure that I do it well and don't give up in between. So, every day after dinner at around 10 p.m., I used to stop doing everything else and used to come back to my room to start learning these things. So, 10 p.m. here is my trigger. 10 p.m. is when I would stop doing everything else. I would lock in and disconnect from the world.

and the actual beauty of this is, you can design your own trigger, 
your trigger can be an alarm , a timer , a specific period in college, or after your everyday chores. 

the timing isn't the issue, it's you ability to lock in.
