some of you were like how can money be a goal ?

I mean sure,

money doesn't buy happiness, but there are rich people who are way happier than you. 

so if you are ambitions , should money even be your goal ? 

you see, happiness isn't about circumstance, its just about your perspective.

You can choose what fulfills you


if your goal is to upskill - to build whatever i want, if i have an idea about a app , i should be able to be able to build it , the things i can build should be limited to my imagination and ideas not my skill.


but remember that , its not the achievements that make you happy , its the growth you make in that process.

How then again do you adapt ? but how do you grow ?

[[adapt]]
