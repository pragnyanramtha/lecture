Some of you were like, "How can money be a goal?"

I mean, sure, money doesn't buy happiness, but there are rich people who are way happier than you. 

So if you are ambitious, should money even be your goal? 

You see, happiness isn't about circumstance; it's just about your perspective.

You can choose what fulfills you.

If you can't do everything, just choose one thing and hone it to its absolute perfection.

But remember that it's not the achievements that make you happy; it's the growth you make in that process.

So how do you adapt? But how do you grow?
