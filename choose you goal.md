money doesn't buy happiness, but there are rich people who are way happier than you. 

so if you are ambitions , should money even be your goal ? 

happiness isn't about circumstance, its just about your perspective.

You can choose what fulfils you 

and i choose 3 things, skill - status and relationships 

skill - to build whatever i want 

status - to have to freedom to choose what i own, to buy what i want 

relationships - so i can share that life with whoever i want. 

but remember that , its not the achievements that that make you happy , its the growth you make in that process.

but how do you grow , How do you adapt ?
