some of you were like how can money be a goal ?

I mean sure,

money doesn't buy happiness, but there are rich people who are way happier than you. 

so if you are ambitions , should money even be your goal ? 

you see, happiness isn't about circumstance, its just about your perspective.

You can choose what fulfills you

If you can't do everything, just choose one thing and hone it to its absolute perfection.

but remember that , its not the achievements that make you happy , its the growth you make in that process.

How then again do you adapt ? but how do you grow ?
