some of you were like how can money be a goal ?

I mean sure,

money doesn't buy happiness, but there are rich people who are way happier than you. 

so if you are ambitions , should money even be your goal ? 

happiness isn't about circumstance, its just about your perspective.

You can choose what fulfils you

and i choose 3 things which i think you choose too , skill - status and relationships 

Kinda vague , but let me explain myself 

skill - to build whatever i want, if i have an idea about a app , i should be able to be able to build it , the things i can build should be limited to my imagination and ideas not my skill.

And secondly 

status - to have to freedom to choose what i own, to have the ability to buy what i want 

relationships - so i can share that life with whoever i want. 

but remember that , its not the achievements that make you happy , its the growth you make in that process.

How then again do you adapt ? but how do you grow ?
