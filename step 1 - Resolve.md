To start doing anything in life, you need to have resolve, your internal reasoning for why you are doing it.

Your long-term goal is what gives rise to your short-term resolve.

If your resolve is weak, you procrastinate, you lose. If your resolve is strong, you get better. Not much to explain here.

I get it, alright? Programming feels boring. It's such a pain in the ass. It's not cool. It requires a lot of mental effort, and you learn all these boring concepts that make you question why.

Computer science is a field where it takes the longest time to get the fruits of your labor (and so are all other fields), so the least thing you can do is make it cooler, more challenging, more dramatic than it actually is.

Imagine someone made a web series of your life. You are the main character, seven episodes, each one showing how your day looks for an entire week. But here is what your day looks like:

You spend most of your time sleeping, scrolling, and playing games.

No dreams, no hobbies, no growth. 

Because even in a story, you want the main character to do something, to adapt, to grow, to win. 

Every person has their own way of perceiving things. Everyone has their own likes and their own views of
what they think are cool.

All you have to do is imagine a little bit, see things a bit differently, and this will make all the difference in the world.

Once you do this enough, I assure you, computer science will be the coolest thing that you ever do.

here is one way to imagine it.

Now that was a soccer goal, but I argue that your goals can look just like this.

If you ever feel bored, or if you feel like every day is the same, it needs to change, right now.

And it can only happen when you do, when you grow every day, you notice the change. 

But Ramtha, how do I actually grow? It's simple.

Most things in life can be categorized into 5 things, skills and abilities, we call them. 

To get to know about this, you need to ask yourself, who are you exactly? I mean sure you give people your name, but what defines you exactly?

Well, the Indian education system thinks it's 2 things:

1. Your pattern recognition ability: things like how well are you able to remember the things that you have already learnt, how well are you able to recognize problems you have already done.
2. And the second thing is your problem-solving ability: how well are you able to derive solutions given non-trivial information.

But people are not just defined based on that; there are many other things too.

Some skills are not taught in schools, and many people don't realize that learning in and of itself is a skill.

And learning that skill will definitely boost the time taken to learn other things by a lot, and once you realize this, you will observe that you start learning other things way faster than normal.

Yes, surely there are some things that you cannot learn, but there are also things that you will realize, and your views will change.

And sometimes you feel like you have reached the limit, but turns out there are other things you have to learn before going all in on something.

And when you learn, you can indeed use these concepts to grow in other fields too.

And when you do, your view upon the world will change; you start finding new things much more important than previous ones.

And when you actually love what you are doing, you will become the top 1% in that skill. 

sure you will have a different, skill set based on who you are , but the process you learn is still the same.
