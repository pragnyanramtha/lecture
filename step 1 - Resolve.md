to start doing anything in life, you need to have resolve 
your internal reasoning for why you are doing it

your long term goal is what gives rise to your short term resolve.

if your resolve is weak, you procrastinate , you lose , if your resolve is strong , you win. that't it.

I get it all right, programming sometimes feels boring, its such a pain in the ass, its not cool, it requires a lot of mental effort , and these boring concepts that make you question why ?

computer science is a field where it takes the longest time to get fruits of your labor (and so are all other fields), so the least thing you can do is make it cooler, more challenging, more dramatic than it actually is.

every person has their own way of perceiving things, everyone has their own likes and their own views of what they things they think are cool.

all you have to do is imagine see things a bit a differently a little bit differently and this will make all the difference in the world.   

once you do this enough, i assure you , computer science will be the coolest things that you ever do.

For example, when first started learning this programming, I had to make sure that I do it well and don't give up in between. So, i set at a specific time on phone during which a specific tune would play,

this sound , when i would hear it , I used to stop doing everything else and used to come back to my room to start learning these things.

So, So this sound this was my trigger, when this sound played is when I would stop doing everything else. I would lock in and disconnect from the world.

and the actual beauty of this is, you can design your own trigger, 
your trigger can be a specific time, an alarm , a timer , a specific period in college, or after your everyday chores. 

the timing isn't the issue, it's you ability to lock in.
