think about it, if you actually liked what you were doing, would you stop doing it ? would you give up ? that is your obsession.

Imagine someone made a web series of your life. You are the main character, seven episodes, each one showing how your day looks for an entire week. But here is what each episode looks like:

the main character spends most of your time sleeping, scrolling, and playing games in the remaining time.

No dreams, no hobbies, no growth. 

I mean would you even watch your own story ? 

Because even in a story, you want the main character to do something, to adapt, to grow, to win.

if there is really such a thing as destiny , shouldn't you be the one to control it, and not the other way around.

i refuse to have a fate where i look back and i see nothing, i want it to be every bit as fun and daring.

I want to do things that leave a mark on me, things I’ll never forget, and I want to do them every single day.

do you even remember that last reel you watched ? , if not are you sure that it made you happy ?
