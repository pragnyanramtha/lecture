To start doing anything in life, you need to have resolve, your internal reasoning for why you are doing it.

Your long-term goal is what gives rise to your short-term resolve.

If your resolve is weak, you procrastinate, you lose. If your resolve is strong, you win. Not much to explain here.

I get it, alright? Programming feels boring. It's such a pain in the ass. It's not cool. It requires a lot of mental effort, and you learn all these boring concepts that make you question why.

Computer science is a field where it takes the longest time to get the fruits of your labor (and so are all other fields), so the least thing you can do is make it cooler, more challenging, more dramatic than it actually is.

imagine someone made a web series of your life ? and you are the main character , seven episodes , each one showing how your day looks for an entire week ? but here is what your day looks like.

you spend most of your time sleeping , scrolling , playing games.

no dreams , no hobbies , no growth. 

cuz even in a story , you want the main character to do something, to adapt, to grow, to win. 

Every person has their own way of perceiving things. Everyone has their own likes and their own views of what they think are cool.

All you have to do is imagine a little bit, see things a bit differently, and this will make all the difference in the world.

Once you do this enough, I assure you, computer science will be the coolest thing that you ever do.

here is one way to imagine it.

many people don't realize that learning in on itself is a skill.

and learning that skill will definitely boost your time taken to learn other things by a lot, and once you realize you will observe that you start learning other things way faster than normal.

yes surely there are some things that you cannot learn, but there are also things that you will realize, your views will change.

and sometimes you feel like you have reached the limit , but turns out there are other things you have to learn before going all in on something.

and when you learn and you can indeed use these concepts to grow in other fields too.

and when you do, your view upon the world will change, you start finding new things much more important that previous ones.

and when you actually love what you are doing, you will become the top 1 % in that skill. 

for this to be possible you need to evolve.
