To start doing anything in life, you need to have resolve, your internal reasoning for why you are doing it.

Your long-term goal is what gives rise to your short-term resolve.

If your resolve is weak, you procrastinate, you lose. If your resolve is strong, you get better. Not much to explain here.

I get it, alright? computer science feels boring. It's such a pain in the ass. It's not cool like games, fun like movies, engaging like reels.

but you see, Computer science is a field where it takes the longest time to get the fruits of your labor (and so are all other fields), so the least thing you can do is make it cooler, more challenging, more dramatic than it actually is.

think about it, if you actually liked what you were doing, would you stop doing it ? would you give up ? that is your obsession.

Imagine someone made a web series of your life. You are the main character, seven episodes, each one showing how your day looks for an entire week. But here is what your day looks like:

You spend most of your time sleeping, scrolling, and playing games.

No dreams, no hobbies, no growth. 

Because even in a story, you want the main character to do something, to adapt, to grow, to win.

I mean would you even watch your own series ? 

I refuse to live a life that's boring and meaningless, i always wondered , why was i born , what is my purpose ? and i am going to keep asking myself that question again and again until i find the answer.

if there is really such a thing as my destiny , i should be the one to control it, not the other way around.

i refuse to have a fate where i look back and i see nothing, i want it to be every bit as fun and daring.

heck, i wanna do things that i never forget, and i wanna do them everyday. and i think that's what i call happiness.

do you even remember that last reel you watched ? , if not are you sure that it made you happy ?

Every person has their own way of perceiving things. Everyone has their own likes and their own views of
what they think are cool.

All you have to do is imagine a little bit, see things a bit differently, and this will make all the difference in the world.

Once you do this enough, I assure you, computer science will be the coolest thing that you ever do.

If you ever feel bored, or if you feel like every day is the same, it needs to change, right now.

And it can only happen when you do, when you grow every day, you notice the change.
