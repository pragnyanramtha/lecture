There are components inside your laptop that are doing a lot of hard work to run your Python program or your website.

Now, we shall dig into the deepest, darkest depths of software engineering.

The Windows operating system, your browser, your games, and even your wallpaper run on something known as the central processing unit.

Some of you might have heard the phrase "the CPU is like the brain of the computer." What that means is that your CPU, along with a special program known as a "Python interpreter" (an interpreter basically means that the code is being read line by line), which acts as a broker between your code and your computer, takes in your Python program and converts it into binary, which is understandable by a computer and, hence, executable.

Now, the process in which this happens is very complicated and deserves its own lecture, but let's analyze what is happening inside the computer's memory, or "RAM."

Now, if we analyze a program's code as it is being run in a debugger, here is what we might find.
