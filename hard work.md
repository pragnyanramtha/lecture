Now before i explain the next point, here's a question for you.

Have you ever worked really hard to achieve something in your life? Think about it. Have you ever tried to give your best to achieve something in your life and failed? But if you never tried, you should actually try it first. But if you did, maybe you can relate to the next thing that I'm saying. For someone who's working hard towards their goals, 

it is very common for you to feel alone a lot of times to feel like no one actually understands you. They say the most successful people are also the most loneliest, but so are the most hardworking people, So you know what, sometimes, just chill, learn to spend time with yourself. Go out, Have some fun, explore, try out new things.

if you can't be happy with yourself, you can never be happy with anyone else. 

Now the fourth one is the secret to reach your goals faster and it is the exact path i use to achieve goals faster in my life. 

See, as a disclaimer, i  don't consider myself to be successful yet because I'm fighting my own battles every day. I'm just like you, maybe a few steps ahead, but still have a lot to do in my own life.
