I AM Pragnyan Ramtha, Currently 17, and an AI research scientist.

and let me tell you something, I can confidently say that i am way lazier than you but i am still going to achieve more things in my life than you can expect.   

Now if you don't care about getting better keep your earbuds back on and scroll you reels. 

but if you do , listen very closely, because this mindset will change the way the way to think and learn forever.
