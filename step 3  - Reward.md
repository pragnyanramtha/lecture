Now suppose you do lock in every day for 2 hours and sit down? What do you learn?
What are you supposed to do in that two hours?

You see, people put in the effort and then
they think putting in the effort is the only thing that they have to do.

Never confuse movement with progress.
You might be sitting and working every day.
You might be sitting and studying every day,
but if you don't see the results, you're definitely doing something wrong.
And I hate people who say hard work doesn't mean success because it does. 
Hard work will lead to success, but the amount of success will depend upon the direction.

Only do what you need to; focus on what's important, not what's required.

At least understand what you have done, seek out what you have achieved. 

And then you will truly understand how you have grown.
Every time you face a problem you are struggling against, you don't need to start from the bottom. Use what you have learnt in your life, and solve the problems.

For this to be possible, you need to know who exactly you are. Who are you?
What are your abilities? What are your skills? How can you use them to your advantage? What are your limits? How do you break them? 

Get absorbed in the moment,
know your abilities precisely,
control them to their utmost potential,
then challenge yourself to the toughest and hardest thing you can do.
In that moment you will pull out an exceptional performance,
which will push you to the next level.

To the outsiders, it will look like a miracle, but there is a formula to it.

The moment you step outside of your comfort zone, you start growing, you start evolving, and before you realize it, the things you never thought you would be able to do are now within your comfort zone.

You see, there is a time in your life when you know a skill, a concept, and there is a time in your life where you don't know that.

And there is no clear path between these two states; all it takes is a leap of faith outside.

For this to be possible, you need to evolve.

but how do you actually learn , well here is a 5 step method with a example that works well for me.

first you learn something , doesn't matter where , could be class , a yt video, a course etc., but at least you should be able to absorb what someone wanted to actually convey.

second you practice, use what you have to learnt to practice new things , this will teach you how to apply anything you have learnt.

and the third is , experiment, in this part you can have some fun , try out the thing not as intended , test out its limits , boundaries, just so you know how it works under the hood.

next you build something with, it doesn't have to be the perfect greatest application ever made, the least should be able to do is take in some input , and somehow utilize the concept you have learnt along the way.

and the final thing you do once the application is running is refine , check where it could be better or faster. and once you have done the refining part you will most probably realize a way for your program to be better , so now you have another concept to learn.  

a bit hard to understand , well here is an example i use build 100s of applications.

lets say i want to understand about the concept for loops in python, 

lets start with the first thing which is to learn, you absorb as much as you can from any source you can find, well for me rn , all i have is a answer from mrv Q/A booklet.

so i will try my best to absorb the most from this part right here.

with just that one bit of knowledge here i come to a practice , so here is something i do somethings like repeated printing , to really understand the why we are using this loops in programming.

going to the next part we experiment , you see i have been wondering about this part in my program , the range part , so mysterious, i mean lemme have a closer look at it. , hmm , wait is this a function just like all the other functions ? huh , then what is it doing here, 

wait lemme see what it is actually returning , so  lets just give it an arbitrary value and check for what it gives out , i know that all functions sorta take in a input and give out some output , so lets , see , huh , it just prints its self , maybe something is going on inside the program , let me print it as a list.

boom , look at that, so range indeed was just a list , it was a function which took it a integer as input and gave a listlike object as its output .

basically , range is a function which takes in a value as input , and return a list as the output.

interesting, so by experimenting with this i have learnt something which i would probably never have normally known.

now that's out of the way , lets build a flames game,
idk if you have ever played it, but i have, so basically we take in the name of 2 people, remove the common letters, then iterate across both the names using flames, and we check where it lands on.

so how do we implement this in python ?

we first take in 2 inputs , obvi, then maybe its better if we deal with them in lists , instead of actual strings.

now , we here we can use a for loop to remove common letters between , the first and second name.

once we do this , we will have to 2 lists without any common letter now at this point we can just count up the letter in both of them and eliminate options in FLAMES.

and badda boom , there you go , we have our answer.

if you didn't understand that, its alright, no one understands anything by listening, you can only learn something by experiencing, experimenting, building it yourself, not the other way around.

well that's that for how you learn, but there are 2 more things i would like to share with you.
