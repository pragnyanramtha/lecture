Now suppose you do lock in every day for 2 hours and sit down? What do you learn?
What are you supposed to do in that two hours?

You see, people put in the effort and then
they think putting in the effort is the only thing that they have to do.

Never confuse movement with progress.
You might be sitting and working every day.
You might be sitting and studying every day,
but if you don't see the results, you're definitely doing something wrong.
And I hate people who say hard work doesn't mean success because it does. 
Hard work will lead to success, but the amount of success will depend upon the direction.

Only do what you need to; focus on what's important, not what's required.

At least understand what you have done, seek out what you have achieved. 

And then you will truly understand how you have grown.

For this to be possible, you need to know who exactly you are. Who are you?
What are your abilities? What are your skills? How can you use them to your advantage? What are your limits? How do you break them? 

Get absorbed in the moment,
know your abilities precisely,
control them to their utmost potential,
then challenge yourself to the toughest and hardest thing you can do.
In that moment you will pull out an exceptional performance,
which will push you to the next level.

To the outsiders, it will look like a miracle, but there is a formula to it.

The moment you step outside of your comfort zone, you start growing, you start evolving, and before you realize it, the things you never thought you would be able to do are now within your comfort zone.

You see, there is a time in your life when you know a skill, a concept, and there is a time in your life where you don't know that.

And there is no clear path between these two states; all it takes is a leap of faith outside.
