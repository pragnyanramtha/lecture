When survival is guaranteed, purpose disappears.
When everything is convenient, curiosity dies.
When you are stripped of a challenge, it erases the need for you to evolve.

It's not easy. No one said it was. Your daily life is flooded with information and entertainment. It's an endless hell to cover up your boredom and anxiety.

People can't get absorbed into something so easily. For example, you might passively get into a trance-like state on your phone, but that's not the adaptation state available exclusively for you. Hence, I wouldn't call it learning in my book. 

The excitement you gain when you find a new weapon, the thrill you feel when you have reached a goal, this joy is something that only belongs to you.

That's what I call true evolution.

The best place to learn is when you are on the edge of death.
And the best time to learn is yesterday.

but the second best place is right outside of your comfort zone and and   

whenever you feel like you are under pressure, you are suffocating, when you have no idea what you are doing , when you feel like you are going to fail. i want you to smile, because you will look back one day and realize that the moment you were suffering the most is also the moment you will grow the fastest. so don't run from it , don't escape it , embrace stress.

and remember how you respond right now , how you stand up and push through.

this will transform you into something much more.

don't crumble from the pressure but rise from it.
