when survival is guaranteed, purpose disappears.
when everything is convenient, curiosity dies.
when you are striped of a challenge, it erases the need for you to evolve.

its not easy, no one said , it was , your daily life is flooded with information and entertainment, its a endless hell to cover up your boredom and anxiety.

See, every time you try to lock in and learn something , the world doesn't really what you to. So, it will start disturbing you in multiple ways. It'll make sure that you get a call from your friends. the world wants you to go chill, it wants you to scroll reels, it wants you to play games It wants you to feel bored and sleep. It'll throw all these things at you just so that you can't lock in.

people cant get absorbed into something so easily, for example, you might passively get into a trance like state on your phone , but that's not the evolution state available exclusively for you. hence i wouldn't call it as adapting in my book.

the excitement you gain when you find a new weapon, the thrill you feel when you have reach a goal , this joy is something that only belongs to you.

That's what i call true evolution.

the best place to learn is when you are the edge of death.
and the best time to learn is yesterday.

but the second best place and time to adapt is right here and right now.
