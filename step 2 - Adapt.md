When survival is guaranteed, purpose disappears.
When everything is convenient, curiosity dies.
When you are stripped of a challenge, it erases the need for you to evolve.

It's not easy. No one said it was. Your daily life is flooded with information and entertainment. It's an endless hell to cover up your boredom and anxiety.

See, every time you try to lock in and learn something, the world doesn't really want you to. So, it will start disturbing you in multiple ways. It'll make sure that you get a call from your friends. The world wants you to go chill, it wants you to scroll reels, it wants you to play games. It wants you to feel bored and sleep. It'll throw all these things at you just so that you can't lock in.

People can't get absorbed into something so easily. For example, you might passively get into a trance-like state on your phone, but that's not the adaptation state available exclusively for you. Hence, I wouldn't call it evolution in my book.

The excitement you gain when you find a new weapon, the thrill you feel when you have reached a goal, this joy is something that only belongs to you.

That's what I call true evolution.

The best place to learn is when you are on the edge of death.
And the best time to learn is yesterday.

But the second best place and time to adapt is right here and right now.
