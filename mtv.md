 

I AM Pragnyan Ramtha, Currently 17, and an AI research scientist. 

and let me tell you something, I can confidently say that i am way lazier than you but i am certain that i can achieve things in my life than you can never expect.   

Now if you simply don't care about getting better or if your goal is not to be the best you can go ahead and relax.

but if you do , listen very closely, because this mindset will change the way the you think and learn forever.
