I am Pragnyan Ramtha, 17 y/o, and I'm currently working as an open-source contributor.

That's the part some of you know.

But let me tell you something: I can confidently say that I am way lazier than you, but I am certain that I can achieve things in my life that you can never expect.

Now, if you simply don't care about getting better or if your goal is not to be the best, you can go ahead and relax.

But if you do, listen very closely, because this mindset will change the way you think and learn forever.
