Step two, you need to sit down with focus and fight the battle with the world. What do I mean? 

See, every time you try to lock in and learn something , the world doesn't really what you to. So, it will start disturbing you in multiple ways. It'll make sure that you get a call from your friends. the world wants you to go chill, it wants you to scroll reels, it wants you to play games It wants you to feel bored and sleep. It'll throw all these things at you just so that you can't lock in.

its not easy, no one said , it was , your daily life is flooded with information and entertainment, its a endless hell to cover up your boredom and anxiety.

people cant get absorbed into something so easily, for example, you might passively get into a trancelike state on your phone , but that's not the locking in state available exclusively for you. hence i wouldn't call it as locked in within my book.

the excitement you gain when you find a new weapon, the thrill you feel when you have reach a goal , this joy is something that only belongs to you.

That's what i call "Flow".
