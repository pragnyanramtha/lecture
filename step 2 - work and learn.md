Step two, you need to sit down with focus and fight the battle with the world. What do I mean? 

See, every time you try to lock in and learn something , the world doesn't really what you to. So, it will start disturbing you in multiple ways. It'll make sure that you get a call from your friends. the world wants you to go chill, it wants you to scroll reels, it wants you to play games It wants you to feel bored and sleep. It'll throw all these things at you just so that you can't lock in.  It's you versus the entire world. And you have to decide what you have to do.

Now suppose you do lock in everyday for 2 hours and sit down ? what do you learn ?
what are you supposed in that two hours ?

you see people put in the efforts and then
they think putting the efforts is the only thing that they have to do.

never confuse movement with progress.
You might be sitting and working every day.
You might be sitting and studying every day,
but if you don't see the results, you're definitely doing something wrong.
And I hate people who say hard work doesn't mean success because it does. 
Hard work will lead to success, but the amount of success will depend upon the direction.

only do what you need to, focus on what's important not what's required.

understand what you have done, seek out what you have achieved. 

and then you will truly understand how you have grown.
