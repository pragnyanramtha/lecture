Now, this gets us to the second point, which is to stop living like a rat in someone's cage.

For a very long time in my life, 
I used worry about what other people think of me very seriously. 
Every single time i wanted to try new stuff, I used to think about what will my relatives think of me, what will my friends, what will my parents think of me ? 

You don't need to be the guy who they think you are .

You can change your character based on the goals you have.
you don't need to give a shit about what others will think of you. 

So sometimes feel free to break the image that people have about you just because you can.
