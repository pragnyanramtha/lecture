Now, this gets us to the second point, which is to stop living like a rat in someone's cage.

For a very long time in my life, 
I used to used what other people think of me very seriously. 
Every single time wanted to try new stuff, I used to think about what will my relatives think of me, friends, parents, what will they even think of me. 

So, you're not a slave of someone's image of you. You're a free bird just as they are and you can do whatever the i you want if it aligns with your goals. So sometimes feel free to break the image that people have about you just because you can. 

Do i look like i give a shit about my appearance?

Do you really think I care about what everyone thinks about me ?
