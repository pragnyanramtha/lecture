Artificial intelligence is scary.

It has been taking over jobs at an incredible rate, and most people fear that it will put an end to white-collar jobs. But there is something.

You know what's the thing that really differentiates us from AI? It's not the fact that we know syntax. Syntax is not really a skill; it's rote memory. It's the ability to memorize a new alphabet. The thing that makes you so valuable is our ability to apply the syntax with experience and the right idea to solve that exact problem.

What you really need is the right idea, and it is a very abstract idea, which means it generalizes. So when you keep doing problems, you develop a natural instinct to recognize patterns and find the right syntax to reproduce these patterns.
