You know funny thing actually about how volatile our lives are  , how even the smallest changes to you life in the past year could have totally thrown you of into a different college where we would have never met.

the answers you put in your eamcet or Jee paper randomly exactly happen to be the right amount for you too be here today with me.

I want you to think about this , if you even have made a slightly different choice, this would have entirely changed the people you were with , your friends , would never exist , your friend group would be totally different , and your friend group has a huge effect on your personality.

but times change , its not a option you are here , but rather a fact.
its the cold hard truth. 

unfortunate, the ocean is calm now , and i am your classmate for the next 2 years , whether you like it or not.
