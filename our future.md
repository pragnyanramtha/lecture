[[japanese quote]]


You know funny thing actually about how volatile our lives are  , how even the smallest changes to you life in the past year could have totally thrown you of into a different college where we would have never met.

the answers you put in your eamcet or Jee paper randomly exactly happen to be the right amount for you too be here today with me.

but times change , its not a option you are here , but rather a fact.
its the cold hard truth. 

and let me tell you something, the fact that your fate is connected with mine changes of lot of things in our life.

just my mere existence fundamentally changes your progress
