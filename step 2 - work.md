Step two, you need to sit down with focus and fight the battle with the world. What do I mean? 


See, every time you sit to work on something, the world doesn't really want you to sit and work on it. So, it will start disturbing you in multiple ways. It will make sure that you have to go on a party with friends. It'll make sure that you get a call from your girlfriend or your boyfriend. Itll throw all these bad things at you just so that you can't sit and focus. The world will throw everything at you because it doesn't want you to be consistent. It wants you to go chil. It wants you to feel bored and sleep. It wants you to go out with your friends, get drunk, watch some porn, and sleep. It's you versus the entire world. And you have to decide what you have to do.
