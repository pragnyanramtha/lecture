## 3. Stop Watching


and that begs the question how do i become a good

problem solver the answer is go solve a

bunch of problems turn off youtube and

go write some code will you ever learn

to play guitar by watching other people

on youtube play guitar the answer is no

you also need to be playing the guitar

along with them books and tutorials are

great sign up for fireship pro but

they're utterly useless if you're not

coding along with them in my tutorials i

try to set you up with something cool to

build so you can go have fun and fail on

your own you can build things based on

tutorials you can try to build your own

stuff you can do coding challenges

participate in hackathons and all kinds

of other stuff if you're serious you

should be coding at least a couple hours

every day there's a reason they require

pilots to have a certain number of

flying hours experience matters more

than anything else and luckily for you

to get time in the saddle all you have

to do is sit on your ass in front of

your computer screen and hit the

keyboard until something cool happens

## 4. Stay Healthy

speaking of which sitting on your ass in

front of a computer screen is not

natural or healthy and that means you

need to work extra hard in this line of

work to protect your health both

mentally and physically that's why i

prefer to eat at arby's the most trusted

name and nutrition i also get plenty of

sunshine and exercise to offset the time

i spend banging my head against the

keyboard in my mom's dark windowless

basement if your health is not optimal

you won't learn as efficiently and

there's no activity in the world that's

worth sacrificing your health over now

## 5. Feynman Technique

let's switch gears and talk about a

physicist named richard feynman he's a

nobel prize winner known for many things

one of which is his learning technique

it goes like this choose a concept you

want to learn about explain it to a 12

year old reflect refine simplify then

organize and review in other words you

learn most efficiently when you try to

teach the very thing you're learning i

can tell you right now that i've learned

way more about programming from running

this youtube channel than i ever did

working all by myself now that doesn't

mean that everybody needs to go and

start a youtube channel all you have to

do is pretend to teach something but if

you can create valuable content out of

it like a video or blog post that's even

better or if you already have a job

you'll find that you learn a lot just by

mentoring other people or if you don't

have a job you can join programming

slack or discord channels and help

people out there or answer questions on

stack overflow helping others feels good

and it forces you to be extremely

precise about what you actually know

here's how it might look for a

programmer choose a topic like i want to

program a video game do some research

and experimenting and write a summary

explaining the technology to a 12 year

old then go and build something and get

to a full working demo as quickly as

possible it doesn't need to be perfect

because in the final step you'll go back

and refactor and simplify and find ways

to improve your process and get feedback

from someone more experienced than you

if possible so approach it like a

teacher even though you have no idea

what you're currently teaching now i

## 6. Dopamine Hits

said something very subtle but very

important and that is to build a full

working demo as quickly as possible

learning is supposed to be painful but

there also needs to be some kind of

reward for that pain and the more

quickly you can get to those rewards the

better because what you want is a

positive feedback loop that basically

makes you addicted to coding there are

ways we can hack the most primitive

parts of our brain what i do almost

every day before i go to bed is write

down a few small goals that i want to

achieve the next day the important thing

is that the goals are achievable because

then writing a check mark next to that

goal feels good when good things happen

your brain releases dopamine and you

want to try to find activities that

after hard work give you that dopamine

hit because otherwise you'll have a

negative feedback loop in which case

you're going to absolutely hate coding

in no time that'd be like learning how

to press the strings on a guitar without

ever knowing how to play an actual song

the idea is to work hard and be rewarded

but you don't want to work too hard it's

## 7. Not Too Hard tho

extremely important especially for

programming to pace yourself and take

regular breaks for most people that

likely means one or two hours of

programming followed by a nice long

break i remember in my early days being

absolutely determined to not let the

error messages win i'd go late into the

night stack overflowing every possible

combination of questions only to give up

and get a good night's sleep and then

come back and immediately solve the

problem in the morning and this isn't

unique to me it happens to everybody

because mental spacing is actually a

very important thing you can be mentally

exhausted while at the same time your

ego is saying you got this bro don't be

a loser but the reality is that the most

efficient thing to do is go outside get

some sunshine jump in a cold body of

water and get some sleep when you wake

up you'll be ready to crush it once

again now that you know how to learn to

## 8. Learn Like a Pro

code all you have to do is go to google

type in what you want to learn and let

it be your guide because that's

basically all you ever do as a software

engineer i'm going to go ahead and wrap
